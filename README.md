This Visual Studio Code Extension provides support of Wikitext Markup language. With this extension, you can more easily discover your grammatical problems through the marked and styled text. The plugin is based on MediaWiki's Wikitext standard, but the rules are somewhat stricter, which helps users write text that is easier to read and maintain.

Of course, the development of this extension is short, and there may be some errors in operation and labeling. If you find a problem, please report it to me immediately for resolution.

If you get help with this project, give this project a star or recommend it to others, thanks!ðŸ˜¸

## Features

- Color and style annotations of Wikitext can make it easier for users to intuitively find problems in writing grammatical formats. <br />

- Automatic matching and closing of simple parentheses reduces unnecessary double typing. <br />

- The special comment syntax\(`<!--#region-->`&`<!--#endregion-->`\) can folds the code for easy reading. <br />

- Press `Ctrl + Shift + V` directly in the Wikitext content to get a parsed preview of Wikitext in the currently active text editor.<br />

- You can modify the website content by logging in directly in VSCode! Enter the settings page, search Wikitext and find the username and password items, and fill in them. Then press `F1` in the text editor, select `Post your page to the website`!

- Obtain the Wikitext source code directly in VSCode according to the page name without opening the web page. Press `F1` and select `Pull page to edit` to use this function.

- Browse the page by entering the page name. Press `F1` then select `View the page`.
