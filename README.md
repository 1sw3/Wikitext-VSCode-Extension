This Visual Studio Code Extension provides support of Wikitext Markup language. With this extension, you can more easily discover your grammatical problems through the marked and styled text. The plugin is based on MediaWiki's Wikitext standard, but the rules are somewhat stricter, which helps users write text that is easier to read and maintain.

Of course, the development of this extension is short, and there may be some errors in operation and labeling. If you find a problem, please report it to me immediately for resolution.

## Features

- Color and style annotations of Wikitext can make it easier for users to intuitively find problems in writing grammatical formats.

- Automatic matching and closing of simple parentheses reduces unnecessary double typing.

## Requirements

Please ensure that your VSCode version is higher than 1.41.0, this version requirements may change in the future.

Generally speaking, make sure that your VSCode is always the latest version.
